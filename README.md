Experiments on MechineLearning

1. Neural Networks  - a. Back propagation
                      b. Hopfield

      a. Back propagation :
                 Activation function - Sigmoid f(t) = 1/1+e^(-t)
                                       derivation of sigmoid : SigmoidP = f(x)(1-f(x))
                                       
                sample Tic tac toe game has been implemented to teach the moves to neural player
